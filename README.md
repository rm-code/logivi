# LoGiVi

LoGiVi is a git-repository visualisation tool inspired by [Gource](https://code.google.com/p/gource/) and __currently in development__. It was written from scratch using [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) and the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework.
It works with Spring and Charge: Spring is used to create a distance between nodes and the charge force will attract them to be visible on the screen size. The result will be an excellent and exact visualization of your git-nodes!

# Instructions
When you run LoGiVi for the first time it will set up all necessary folders, an example git log and a config file in the save directory on your harddrive. A dialog will pop up which allows you to view the save directory.

## Generating git logs automatically
LoGiVi can generate git logs automatically when you specify a path to a git repository on your harddrive. Open the _settings.cfg_ file in the LoGiVi save directory and look for the _[repositories]_ section. Add the absolute path to the folder containing the git repository like this:

```
[repositories]
logivi = /Users/Robert/Coding/Lua/LÖVE/LoGiVi/
```
The name on the left side of the equals sign will be used as the project name to identify this repository so make sure you use unique names here. 

LoGiVi can also handle Windows paths:

```
[repositories]
logivi = C:\Users\rmcode\Documents\Coding Projects\LoGiVi\
```
After you have added the paths of your project to the config file, the log and info files will be created the next time you run LoGiVi (this may take a few seconds depending on how large the repositories are). 

## Generating git logs manually
If you don't want the logs to be generated automatically, or if you don't have git in your PATH, you can also generate the git logs manually. 

Open your terminal and type in the following command (replace the path with your own path leading to a git repository):

```bash
git -C "Path/To/Your/Repository" log --reverse --numstat --pretty=format:"info: %an|%ae|%ct" --name-status --no-merges > log.txt
```
This will create the file _log.txt_ in the folder you are currently in. Take this newly created file and drop it into a folder in the _logs_ subfolder in the LoGiVi save directory:

```
/Users/Robert/Library/Application Support/LOVE/rmcode_LoGiVi/logs/yourProject/log.txt
```
LoGiVi will use the folder's name to identify the log so make it informative.
